"""
Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).
Return the running sum of nums.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].

:type nums: List[int]
:rtype: List[int]
